		<h1>How to Coconut Ladoo</h1>
		<p>Coconut, cardamom, and condensed milk star in this super quick and easy Indian dessert that's great for gifting.</p>
		<h1>Ingredients</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>2 cups flaked coconut</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 pinches ground cardamom</li>
            <li>2 drops vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons semolina flour (Optional)</li>
            <li>Â½ cup flaked coconut, or more as needed</li> 
		</ul>
		<h1>Steps</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Place 2 cups coconut into a pan and heat over low heat until lightly toasted, making sure not to burn or change color, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat. Place unopened can of condensed milk into the middle of the pot; boil for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove using tongs; let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Pour into coconut and add cardamom and vanilla extract. Mix well. Let cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Form mixture into small balls using oiled hands, as mixture will be very sticky, adding semolina as needed if very wet and runny.</li>
            <li>Place remaining coconut into a shallow bowl or on a plate. Roll ladoos in coconut and serve.</li>
		</ol>
